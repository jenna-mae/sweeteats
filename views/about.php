                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Red Velvet grew out of a love of baking and entertaining. In a city like New York, baking is no easy task. Ovens are more often filled with sweaters than desserts! We knew there had to be a better way. We believe dessert is about sharing and celebrating with people you care about. We love bringing people together and know you will too.</p>
